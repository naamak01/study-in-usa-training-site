# study-in-usa-training-site
 This website we educate, train and give insights to international students specially F1 Student who are interesting in Studying in the USA.  I am building this site  based on my personal experiences and struggles trying to navigate the application process, all the way through the visa process and life in the USA. Too many students  being scammed and some coming in unprepared. So hopefully this site help with some of these challenges.
