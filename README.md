# study-in-usa-training-site
 This website will educate, train, and give insights to international students, especially F1 Students who are interested in Studying in the USA.  I am building this site  based on my personal experiences and struggles trying to navigate the application process, all the way through the visa process and life in the USA. Too many students  are being scammed and some coming in unprepared. So hopefully this site helps with some of these challenges.

 Will be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this project.

 ## Sample image for the project: It is a work in progress
