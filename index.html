						Studying in a different country can feel overwhelming, right? I get
						it. As an international student myself, I've been through the whole
						journey from researching the United States to living here for the
						past few years. Trust me, I know firsthand how tough it can be. But
						hey, let's not dwell on the tough parts. Yes, it takes a lot of
						time, effort, and resources, but it's also one heck of an adventure.
						You get to explore new cultures, meet amazing people, and grow in
						ways you never imagined.
					</p>

					<p class="intro-p2">
						<br />So, if you're feeling a bit lost or unsure, don't worry.
						Whether you need help with understanding the visa process, adjusting
						to a new academic system, application process advice, or what to do
						when you first arrive, I'm here to provide information and some
						external resources to possibly help answer those questions. Let's
						turn that overwhelming journey into an exciting one together.

						<p class="about-p1">
							If you reading this, I'm Nana Amakye. Currently, I'm an
							international student here in the USA, majoring in Computer
							Science, Marketing, and Management. It's been quite the journey
							seven years of growth, challenges, and experiences that have
							shaped me into who I am today.
						</p>

						<p class="about-p2">
							To be real with you, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. I vividly
							remember arriving in the United States with just $130 to my name,
							facing months of financial struggle and relying on cafeteria meals
							to get by. Tuition payments felt like a mountain to climb, but
							thankfully, fate brought some incredible people into my life.
							Their guidance, support, and kindness turned my world around when
							I needed it most.
						</p>

						<p class="about-p2">
							Now, I wish I could spill all the details here, but trust me,
							there's more to my story than meets the eye. If you're curious to
							learn about the highs, the lows, and everything in between, watch
							the video below
